# DeathStar

Everyone seems to be complaining about the beam ability being too OP so I buffed it...

## Features
- Beam is permanently large
- Gravity applies while using the beam
- Beam rotates faster
- The beam has a huge amount of recoil

All of these features together allow you to effectively fly using the beam.
